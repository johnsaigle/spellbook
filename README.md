# Spell Book

## What the hell is this?

Sometimes in while deep in the computer you find something really cool or useful 
and want to tell a friend about it. But maybe it's too obscure even for other,
nerds. Or maybe they don't use the same software as you. Or maybe you've tried
wading through SO answers and after trying the basics you are still stuck.

This is a place for things like that.

This repository is a collection of little cheat codes, spells, unstructured
notes and maybe even opinionated musings that are derived from a lifetime
spent at the keyboard.

Some of the contents are objectively and immediately useful.

Most of it will be like a drawer full of old cables and adapters that you
will probably never use. On the other hand, maybe they're exactly what
you would otherwise spend hours looking for.

## Philosophy 

- I love free software but I sometimes am too lazy to orient my whole life around it
- I don't like using my mouse
- I dwell in the terminal as much as possible
- I'm a big fan of [Unix as IDE](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/)
- I feel like being POSIX-ish is probably good most of the time
- I gravitate toward general-purpose tools used in advanced ways over specialized software
- I choose long-standing, popular tools over flavour-of-the-week lifehacks

So that likley boils down to:
- bash scripts
- vim tricks
- other greybeard-inflected tactics

Finally, I'd like this repo to contain mostly unique, niche, but useful commands.
If it's easy to find on StackOverflow I will not include it here. 

## Organization 

TODO: insert output of `tree` command here at some point

I think I'll make a directory for actual scripts and a separate one for notes
and ideas.
